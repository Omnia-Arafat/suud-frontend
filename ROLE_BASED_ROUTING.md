# 🔄 Role-Based Dashboard Routing - SU'UD Platform

## ✅ **PROBLEM SOLVED**

Previously, all users were seeing the same generic dashboard regardless of their role. Now each user role gets redirected to their specific dashboard with appropriate features and functionality.

## 🎯 **ROUTING STRUCTURE**

### **New Dashboard Router** (`/dashboard`)
- **File**: `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- **Function**: Automatically redirects users to role-specific dashboards
- **Logic**:
  ```typescript
  switch (user.role) {
    case 'admin': -> /admin/dashboard
    case 'employer': -> /employer/dashboard  
    case 'employee': -> /employee/dashboard
  }
  ```

### **Role-Specific Dashboards**

- **Layout**: Employer-focused interface
- **Features**:
  - Job posting management
  - Application review and management
  - Candidate browsing
  - Company profile management
  - Hiring analytics
- **Components**: Uses `EmployerLayout` with hiring tools

#### 👨‍💻 **Employee Dashboard** (`/employee/dashboard`)

## 🔐 **AUTHENTICATION FLOW**

1. **Login** → User enters credentials at `/login`
2. **Authentication** → Auth service validates and stores user data with role
3. **Redirect** → Login redirects to `/dashboard` 
4. **Role Detection** → Dashboard router reads user role
5. **Final Redirect** → User lands on their specific dashboard

export default function DashboardRouter() {
  const { user, isLoading } = useAuth();
  const router = useRouter();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!isLoading && user) {
      switch (user.role) {
        case 'admin':
          router.replace('/admin/dashboard');
          break;
        case 'employer':
          router.replace('/employer/dashboard');
          break;
        case 'employee':
          router.replace('/employee/dashboard');
          break;
      }
    }
  }, [user, isLoading, router]);

  return <PageSkeleton />;
}
```
