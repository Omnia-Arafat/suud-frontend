## How to Test Different Dashboards

### Testing Credentials

- Email: `admin@suud.com` or any email containing "admin"
- Password: Any password (mock authentication)
- Redirects to: `/admin/dashboard`

#### **Employer Access**
- Email: `employer@company.com` or any email containing "employer" or "company"
- Password: Any password (mock authentication)
- Redirects to: `/employer/dashboard`

#### **Employee Access**
- Email: `employee@example.com` or any other email
- Password: Any password (mock authentication)
- Redirects to: `/employee/dashboard`

## Architecture

### Backend (Laravel)
- **Role-based middleware**: `AdminMiddleware`, `EmployeeMiddleware`, `EmployerMiddleware`
- **Dedicated controllers**: Each role has its own dashboard controller
- **API routes**: Role-specific endpoints under `/admin/*`, `/employee/*`, `/employer/*`
- **Authentication**: Sanctum token-based with role verification

### Frontend (Next.js)
- **Role-based routing**: `RoleBasedRoute` component protects routes by user role
- **Separate layouts**: Each role has its own layout with role-specific navigation
- **Dashboard pages**: Unique dashboard content for each role
- **Auto-redirect**: Login automatically redirects to appropriate dashboard

## File Structure

```
├── src/app/
│   ├── admin/dashboard/page.tsx          # Admin dashboard route
│   ├── employee/dashboard/page.tsx       # Employee dashboard route
│   └── employer/dashboard/page.tsx       # Employer dashboard route
├── src/dashboard/
│   ├── admin/
│   │   ├── layout.tsx                    # Admin layout with navigation
│   │   └── pages/dashboard.tsx           # Admin dashboard content
│   ├── employee/
│   │   ├── layout.tsx                    # Employee layout with navigation
│   │   └── pages/dashboard.tsx           # Employee dashboard content
│   └── employer/
│       ├── layout.tsx                    # Employer layout with navigation
│       └── pages/dashboard.tsx           # Employer dashboard content
└── src/shared/components/auth/
    └── RoleBasedRoute.tsx               # Role-based route protection
```

## Security Features

1. **Route Protection**: Each dashboard route is protected by role-based authentication
2. **Middleware Enforcement**: Backend APIs enforce role permissions
3. **Automatic Redirects**: Users are automatically redirected to their appropriate dashboard
4. **Role Verification**: Frontend continuously verifies user roles and redirects if mismatched

## Next Steps for Development

1. **API Integration**: Replace mock data with real API calls to backend controllers
2. **Additional Routes**: Create additional role-specific pages (user management, job creation, etc.)
3. **Real Authentication**: Replace mock authentication with actual backend integration
4. **Enhanced Features**: Add role-specific functionality like notifications, advanced analytics
5. **Mobile Optimization**: Ensure dashboards work well on mobile devices
